# How-much-does-IVF-cost-in-India-especially-in-Ahmedabad-

IVF cost in India depends on city, doctor, and your case. In 2025, average IVF cost in India is â‚¹1.2 to â‚¹2.5 lakhs per cycle. In Ahmedabad, it's a bit affordable, starting around â‚¹90,000 and going up depending on services.

If you need ICSI, donor eggs, or embryo freezing, cost goes higher. Also, some people need multiple cycles or injections which adds to cost.

Ayuh Fertility Centre in Ahmedabad gives transparent prices. They donâ€™t push unnecessary tests and suggest only whatâ€™s needed. Some clinics offer EMI options or packages too.

Remember, low price doesnâ€™t mean better treatment. Look at the doctorâ€™s experience and lab facility. A failed cycle may cost more later.
